## 1.intoductionn to cloud compuuting
1.overview of cloud computing
what is cloud computing ? 
*cloud computing is a model that delivers the IT services (servers,storages,databases,networking,software ,etc..) over the internet ("the cloud") on a pay -as-you-go basis.It allows individuals and businsses to use powerful computing resources without owning and maintaining physical infraasturcture.
instead of running apllications on your laptop you can run them on servers.
EXAMPLE : 1.when you  watch a  movie on netflix you re streamoing it from cloud servers hosted by aws.
          2.when you store the photos on google drive,they are saved on googles cloud servers.
real life analogy : if youre using electricity at home
you dont build your own powerplant ; ypou just use the service and pay for what you use.
cc is also used in that way - you use resources from cloud providers and pay based on usage.
HISTORY : 2006 : aws-this started the modern era of cc
         today : cloud powerss evrything -from social media apps to ai models like chatgpt.
there are 3 main service models : 1.iaas-infrastructure as a service
the cloud provides the basic infrastructure like services,storages
ex: awsec2,microsoft azure virrtual machine
2.paas -platform as a service
the cloud gives you a platforrm to develop ,ru,and manage
ex : aws elastic beanstalk,google app engine
3.saas : you use ready-made software over the internet.cant mange.
ex : gmail,google drive
2.BENEFITS :  1.cost efficiency : no need to buy expensive serverss;you pay only for what you use.
            2.collaboration : team members can work together from dofferent locations .
            3.scalability : increase or decrease capacity anytime (e-commerce websites during festivals)
            4.sustainability : reduces tthe carbon emissions by shared the resources efficiently.
CHALLENGES : 1.security risks : data stored online may targeted by hackers.
            2.data transfer costs  : moving or retrive the large data can be costly.
            3.vendor lock-in : difficult to  switch from one provider to another.
            4.limited control : you cant directly control or customize perovider-managed servers
            5.skill requirement : requires trained proffessional to manage cloud platforms.
3.TYPES OF CC: three types: 1.public cloud
                            2.private cloud
                            3.hybrid cloud
1.public cloud : *shared by many users (multi-tenant environment)
                 *it can be maanged by third party companies like AWS ,Azure,Google,Cloud.
                 *low cost,easy scalable
     use case : startups or developers launching new apps.
   example : a college project based on aws free tier is public cloud usage.
2.private cloud : *used by a single organization for internal operations.
                  *offers more security,customization,and control.
    use case : banks,,hospitals,and government sectors that manaage senstive information.
  exampke : a bank maintaining its data center using VM ware orr openstack.
3.hybrid cloud : *it is combination of public+private.
                 *allow organizations to keep senstive data private but use the public cloyd for less critical operations.
   use case : a shopping site may keep payment data in private and product images in public.
  example : tcs or infosys using  AWS(public)+their internal private servers(private).
4.INTRODUCTION TO AWS CLOUD
    what the aws makes unique?
      *launched in 2006 by amazon
      *offers 200+ services across different categories.
      *provides data storage and ai tools for all business sizes.
      *used by netflix,nasa,airbnb,tcs.
AWS services:
          service             category               purpose
        amazon ec2          compute        run virtual servers for aplications
        amazon s3          storage        store data,images,and backups
       amazon rds          database       manage realational databases
      aws lambda         serverless       run code without managing the servers
      amazon cloudfront   cdn            deliver the content very quickly
example scenario : 
             suppose you create a photo sharing app
                    * amazon s3 stores photos securely
                    *ec2 runs your web server.
                    *rds holds user account data.
                    *cloudfront makes image loading faster.
aws lets even small teams build scalable apps easily.
5.AWS GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE : 
      aws has a vast global infrastructure designed for speed ,redundancy,and availability
components : 
1.regions : geographical areaas (eg mumbai,singapore,us-east)
2.availabilty zones : multiple data centers inside each region to prevent downtime.
3.edge locations : deliver data faster by caching it near users.
fun factsa : aws has 33+ regions,100+azs,and 450+ edge locations
            aws continues to expand into new countries every year.
            major clients like netflix depend on aws global infrastructure 
example : if you are oin india you choose mumbai region for better performance,location for speed.
